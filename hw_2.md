## Question 1

1. Write a function with the following signature: pythagoreanTheorem(length_a, length_b).

The function returns the length of the hypotenuse assuming that length_a and length_b are the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle (the legs that form the triangle's right angle). Hint: the math module might have useful functions to use.

For example:

>> print(pythagoreanTheorem(2, 2))
   2.8284271247461903
