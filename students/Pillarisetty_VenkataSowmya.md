### Title of the Paper: Reliability comparison of computer networks

**Venue:** IEEE International Conference Paper, New Orleans, LA, USA

**Number of Pages:** 7

**Outcomes of the Paper:**
1. *This paper developed the procedures to compare the reliability characteristics of different networks*
2. *Algorithm to evaluate terminal pair or mean terminal ability is proposed which is based on netwrok simple paths and it permits us an easy comparision between networks*
3. *Method which enumerates all needed simple paths, and measuring computational complexity of algorithm is also presented well*
