Three outcomes of the paper: 1) In the study ,depression was the most commonly
measured outcome. The prominent risk factors for depression, anxiety and psychological distress
emerging from this review comprised time spent on social media, activities such as repeated
checking for messages, personal investment, and addictive or problematic use.

2) The impact of social media use on incidence of depression, anxiety and psychological distress
among adolescents, as examined by this review, is likely to be multifactorial like time spent; activity; investment; and addiction. 

3)Other important findings of this review suggest that particular attitudes or behaviours (e.g.
social comparison, active or passive use of social media, motives for social media use) may have
a greater influence on the symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress than the
frequency of social media use or the number of online friends
