# Heat tolerance in plants: An overview
* **Journal name :** Environmental and Experimental Botany, Volume 61, Issue 3, December 2007, Pages 199-223
* **Number of pages : 5**
* **Three outcomes of the paper**

  **First outcome:**
   ```
   If the temperature raises 10-15C above ambient temperature then it is considered as heat shock or heat stress which will cause significant damage to the plant growth and it might be a serious threat to the crop production worldwide.
   ```
  **Second outcome:**
  ```
  Upper and lower threasholds that a plant can have are dependent on the region the plant grows, season  the plant grows, species and genotypes within species. If the temperature is either above or below the threshold of a particular plant species, then it will effect plant in ways like include structural changes in tissues, disorganization of cell membranes, disturbance of leaf water relations etc. Although in response to heat stress, plants manifest numerous adaptive changes, these changes might not be sufficient if the temperature changes too soon.
  ```
  **Third outcome:**
  ```
  Human activities are substantially  adding to the existing concentration of greenhouse gases and different global circulation models predict that greenhouse gases will gradually increase world's average ambient temperature. Hence it also essential to monitor human activities and to protect plants.
