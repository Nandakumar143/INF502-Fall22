Title: MPI+OpenMP Tasking Scalability for the Simulation of the
Human Brain  
Authors: Valero-Lara et al.
year: 2018
pages: 8
publication: ACM, available on Science Dirrect 

Outcomes
1. Proposed and evaluated implementation of simulating the human brain.
2. Though MPI_AllGather and OpenMP introduced non-negligible overhead, it was shown that the approach reduced programming cost.
3. Future plans are to extend this work with muli-morphology simulations to simulate a higher number of neurons.
