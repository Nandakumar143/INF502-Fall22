Human Brain  
Venue: ACM, available on Science Dirrect 
Number of pages: 8

Three outcomes of the paper:
1. Proposed and evaluated implementation of simulating the human brain.
2. Though MPI_AllGather and OpenMP introduced non-negligible overhead, it was shown that the approach reduced programming cost.
3. Future plans are to extend this work with muli-morphology simulations to simulate a higher number of neurons.
