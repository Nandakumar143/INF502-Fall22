Various types of Software that we use widely are comprised of forever evolving and never-ending processes. These activities are the reasons for achieving the required outcome. Software development methodologies are the activities implemented in the modeling and structuring of software to accomplish the appropriate results.
To develop software, we must be familiar with the requirement and the process to be followed in order to reach the output. The pain points are to be considered and the resources must be estimated. Then, different methods, for instance, waterfall model, Prototype model, Iterative model, or any based on the interest. Frameworks like scrum are to be implemented. Whereas, the Agile development process is for structuring businesses. During the development, the prototype may or may not be productive. It is important to consider the suitable approach while deploying based on the behavior. 
The characteristics of different models' approaches and behaviors are explained in a clear and short way in this paper. This paper also discusses the pain points of different strategies while implementing them in any software development.
