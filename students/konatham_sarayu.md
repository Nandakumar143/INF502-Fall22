- Three outcomes of the paper:

    1.Future networks will likely adopt a data-driven paradigm in order to better support the explosive expansion
 of mobile services and the growing heterogeneity of mobile devices, many of which produce and consume significant amounts of data.

    2.Blockchain is seen as a possible option for future data-driven networks (DDNs), enabling secure data storage, sharing, and analytics, 
user privacy protection, reliable, trustworthy network control, and decentralized routing and resource managements.

    3.Significant difficulties with security, privacy, services providing, and network management are further obstacle to these paper.

    4.In this article, we provide an overview of previous studies on blockchain technology's use in computer networks and suggest problems
 and potential fixes for blockchain technology's use in upcoming DDNs.

    5.Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, is revolutionizing data processing and storage in computer network systems.
 Blockchain is a method for creating distributed ledgers that give an immutable log of transactions recorded in a distributed network.
