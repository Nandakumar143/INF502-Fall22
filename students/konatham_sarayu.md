### Part 2: Using GitHub

The goal of this assignment is to put you in touch with the fork-pull request process, with an extra of dealing a little bit with Markdown. To learn more about Markdown [click here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

To complete this submission, follow these steps:

1. Fork the course repository (available [here](https://github.com/chavesana/INF502-Fall22)).

2. Into the students folder, create a markdown file called LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME.md (please change LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME for your actual last and first names). 

3. Use markdown to write a report of the last paper you've read. You can structure your markdown the way you want, but the following information must be there:
- Title
- Venue (journal name/conference)
- Number of pages
- Three outcomes of the paper
- Link to the paper online

4. Commit your file and push to your own GitHub repository (INF502).

5. Create a pull request to the course repository. Your pull request needs to appear [here](https://github.com/chavesana/INF502-Fall22/pulls).

6. Go back to Part 1 and answer the question 13 based on your experience in solving Part 2.

Your Part 2 submission is complete when your pull request is listed in the link above.
