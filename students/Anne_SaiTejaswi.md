**Venue:** Journal (International Conference Paper by IEEE Pune, India)

**Number of Pages:** 4

**Outcomes of the Paper:**
1. *This paper mainly presented practical method to decentralize and automate the supply chain management process using*
2. *Technology would enable a thorough retrace and traversal of the supply chain tree, enabling the detection of irregularities across multiple levels of the tree, and       would greatly improve customer assistance, helping to lower the mistake rates that occur in various stages of the supply-chain.*
3. *The solution here would replace the current supply chain management systems in an effective and advantageous way.*
