About the paper
```
In todays world the usage of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in device designing is increasing rapidly. Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) is popular and leading technology created for IoT networks. LPWAN is wireless based WAN technology that enables Low power consumption, long range, lower bandwidth with low bit rates.
