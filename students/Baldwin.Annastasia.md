Tile: Renovating the Pyramid of Needs: Contemporary Extensions Built Upon Ancient Foundations
Journal: Perspectives on Psychological Science, May 5, 2010
Pages: 292-314
Outcomes/Discussion:
  SO the paper is a discussio of evolutionary psychology, which is the study of eovlution through a psychological lens entirely based around genes.
  Genes controlled how we evoled, and helped us devlop psychologically into what we are today and play a massive part in our lives still.
  The paper istelf is discussing MAslow's Heirarchy of Needs, the traditional belief that humans require physiological needs to be met before any social or psychological
  needs can be met. Kenrick et. al. rgue that the pyrmaid does not have such strict boundaries and that people can move back and forth on the pyramid, unlike Maslow's model 
  were each is a stepping stone. Kenrick et. al. discuss that an individual may infact begin developing in another step before a previous; however, they do mention
  that the indivudal may be kept from acheiving the full extent that they could do to lack of support from the lower step. Kenrick et. al. propose a new model based off
  of MAslow's, but with n evolutionary lense applied. They believe that immediate phyisological needs must be must first, then social based needs, then mating and 
  reproduction are at the top of the pyramid. This is due to the fact that evolutionary psychology believes that genes drive everything a human does. Genes will 
  wish to reproduce and to continuate themselves, and the way to do that is to mate and create a new human. The genes may evolve over time, and develop new traits,
  but the drive to survive is still hard-wired in.
