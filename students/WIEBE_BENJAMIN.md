# 3 Takeaways of the Paper
1. Populations of *P. fremontii* adapted to hotter climates tend to have higher levels of leaf canopy conductance than populations adapted to colder places
2. Because of this difference in conductance and transpiration, the leaves of these species tend to remain cooler, especially during heat waves
3. This likely represents an adaptation by warm-adapted *P. fremontii* populations to avoid the harmful effects of really high leaf temperatures
