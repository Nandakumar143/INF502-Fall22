### Outcomes of the paper
- Examines data on poverty from NSS surveys and World Bank techniques, as well as different projections of growth and inflation for the period between 2004–5 and 2020–21.
- Shows how the definitions and methods used for measuring survey consumption have led to a significant variation in assessment of policy impact in general, and -pandemic Covid-induced poverty in particular.
- The NSS officially converted to the Modified Mixed Recall Technique after the crisis, but Kochhar (Author) estimated that 75 million Indians were pushed into extreme poverty in 2020–21 using the outdated uniform method.
- A significant portion of the pandemic shock was absorbed by the growth of India's food subsidy program. Through this initiative, insurance is made available to the underprivileged, and India's extreme poverty rate was kept from rising.
