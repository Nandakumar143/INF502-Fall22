### Title of the Paper: Evaluation of Deep Learning Techniques in Sentiment Analysis from Twitter Data

**Venue:** International Conference Paper by IEEE Istanbul, Turkey

**Number of Pages:** 6

**Outcomes of the Paper:**

1. *This paper published deep learning methods based on CNN and LSTM networks are tested for sentiment analysis in Twitter data*
2. *CNN and LSTM networks are combined together due to the effective dimensionality reduction process of CNNâ€™s and the preservation of word dependencies when using LSTM networks *
3. *It allowed to evaluate different deep neural network configurations and experimented with two different word embedding systems under a single dataset and evaluation framework allowing to shed more light on their advantages and limitations*
