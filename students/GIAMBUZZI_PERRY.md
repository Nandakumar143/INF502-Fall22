Warming does not delay the start of autumnal leaf coloration but slows its progress rate

Global Ecology and Biogeography

1. Date of leaf color onset is dominantly controlled by photoperiod
2. Warming temperatures lengthen the progress of leaf senescence in the fall, but do not influence start of leaf coloration date
3. Date of leaf color onset was even less sensitive to temperature in areas with longer photoperiod length.
