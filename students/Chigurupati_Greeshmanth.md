5. Outcomes of the paper: 
   - This is about the day to day problems in remote areas mostly.It allows us to use the software and predict the type of damage caused.
   - The software uses machine learning algoriths and processes image accordingly.
   - It locates the type of damage , location of damage , and most importantly it sends the information to nearest government office so that they will take care of the issue.
